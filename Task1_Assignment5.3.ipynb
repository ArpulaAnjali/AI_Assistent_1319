        "### Q&A\n",
        "The security improvements implemented in the revised code include:\n",
        "1.  **Password Hashing**: Passwords are no longer stored or compared in plain text. Instead, the `hashlib.sha256` algorithm is used to hash passwords, and only the hashed values are stored and compared.\n",
        "2.  **Avoidance of Hardcoded Credentials**: While the example still initializes a user, the structure allows for credentials to be managed more securely (e.g., loaded from a secure configuration or database) rather than being directly embedded in the code. The revised code uses a dictionary to store user credentials, mapping usernames to their hashed passwords.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The initial login system hardcoded the username as 'admin' and the password as 'password123', performing a direct plain text comparison, which was identified as a significant security risk.\n",
        "*   Two primary security risks were identified in the initial system: hardcoded credentials and plain text password comparison.\n",
        "*   The revised code successfully implemented password hashing using the `hashlib.sha256` module.\n",
        "*   User credentials are now stored in a dictionary where usernames are keys and values are SHA256 hashed passwords.\n",
        "*   Input passwords are also hashed before comparison with the stored hashed values, preventing plain text exposure.\n",
        "*   The revised system correctly authenticated a user with the username 'admin' and the password 'password123', indicating the secure login logic is functional.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   For a production-ready system, consider using more robust password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2, which are designed to be more resistant to brute-force attacks due to their computational cost.\n",
        "*   Implement secure storage for user credentials, such as a database, rather than hardcoding them in the application or storing them in a simple dictionary.\n"
