        "This recursive binary search function works by continually narrowing down the search range within a sorted array. Let's break down its components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Function Signature**: `recursive_binary_search(arr, low, high, x)`\n",
        "    *   `arr`: The sorted list (or array) in which we want to search.\n",
        "    *   `low`: The starting index of the current search segment.\n",
        "    *   `high`: The ending index of the current search segment.\n",
        "    *   `x`: The target element we are searching for.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Base Case**: `if high < low: return -1`\n",
        "    *   **Explanation**: This is the termination condition for the recursion. If the `high` index becomes less than the `low` index, it means our search range has become invalid or empty. This implies that the target element `x` is not present in the array, so we return `-1`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Recursive Case (Divide and Conquer)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Calculate Middle**: `mid = (low + high) // 2`\n",
        "        *   The algorithm first finds the middle element of the current search segment. This divides the array into two halves.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Element Found**: `if arr[mid] == x: return mid`\n",
        "        *   If the element at the `mid` index is equal to our target `x`, we have found the element and return its index.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Search Left Half**: `elif arr[mid] > x: return recursive_binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x)`\n",
        "        *   If the element at the `mid` index is greater than `x`, it means that if `x` exists, it must be in the left half of the current segment (because the array is sorted). We then recursively call the `recursive_binary_search` function, updating the `high` index to `mid - 1` to search only in the left subarray.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Search Right Half**: `else: return recursive_binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x)`\n",
        "        *   If the element at the `mid` index is less than `x`, it means that if `x` exists, it must be in the right half of the current segment. We recursively call the function, updating the `low` index to `mid + 1` to search only in the right subarray.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process continues until either the element is found (base case 2 implicit in `if arr[mid] == x`) or the search range becomes empty (base case 1: `high < low`), indicating the element is not present."
